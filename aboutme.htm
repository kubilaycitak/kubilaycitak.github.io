  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img src="vesika.jpg" alt="Me" width="360" height="465"> 
  <p>Hello again! My name is Kubilay Çıtak, I am 22 years old and I am a second grade computer engineering student in Anadolu University. My hometown is also Eskisehir, a little town called Cifteler. Before coming to study here, I lived in Balikesir for almost 10 years, so there is also like a hometown to me. My dad is a retired army member, and my mom is a housewife. </p>
  <p>To be honest, becoming a computer engineer was not exactly my dream. I always wanted to be a doctor since I was a child, but I could not succeed to get in medicine school. I was not prepared for computer programming, but as the time passed, I loved programming more and more and today I can say that I am glad that I am here. Now I am trying to learn programming in Android, and I hope I'll learn other programming languages as well.  </p>
  <p>I try to be social in school groups, I am a member of computer club in out school and GDG Eskisehir, a community that arranges programming based events with the support of Google. </p>
  <p>I have been playing bass guitar for 8 years and drums for 4 years. In my first days in Eskisehir I looked for some bands to play with, but then I realized "being an engineer" would not let me have so much free time... I had two bands in Balikesir and a song that we created with one of those bands. I love making music and I am kind of pretentious about that. </p>
  <p>I also love sports. Maybe I am a little "paunchy" at the moment but I used to be a sportsman... I won a inter-high school tennis cup in Balikesir and I also was the goalkeeper of my high school's soccer team. I am a Fenerbahce fan, and I really enjoy watching every kind of sports. </p>
  <p>The worst thing about myself is my book culture is so weak. I do not know why, but I am not a bookworm and it makes me kind of sad. I really would like to discuss books with my friends but I can not right now, I hope someday I'll be able to do that. </p>
  <p>Now I realized that I can talk like that forever, so I better stop here. Thank you for taking time reading the things about me.</p>
